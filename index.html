      <h1>Lightsaber Combat</h1>
      <div class="form1">
        <h2>Form I</h2>
        <p>
          There are 7 lightsaber combat forms, the first is called
          <strong>Shii-cho</strong>, this can also be<br />
          called, <strong>The Way of the Sarlacc</strong>, or
          <strong>The Determination form</strong>. This style was created
          when<br />
          the jedi were transitioning from metal swords to lightsabers, and
          guided the user through basic<br />
          forms; however, since this was created before the emergence of Dark
          Jedi or Sith it<br />
          didn’t address lightsaber to lightsaber combat and was replaced by
          form 2. While form 1<br />
          is mostly used to train the basics of lightsaber combat, when used
          against an opponent<br />
          it is wild and raw, relying on tactics, and prioritizes disarming the
          opponent over injuring them.<br />

        <h2>Form II</h2>
        <p>
          Form 2 of the 7 lightsaber forms is called <strong>Makashi</strong>,
          also known as<br />
          <strong>The Way of the Ysalamiri</strong>, or
          <strong>The Contention Form</strong>. Form 2 was created to counter<br />
          form one’s sweeping movements, it is a form the prioritizes precision
          over power. This form<br />
          uses jabs, parries, and light cuts over slashes, blocks, and chops, it
          also required precise<br />
          movements and expert timing. The foundation of the form lies in the
          footwork, shifting their<br />
          feet to maintain perfect balance, using this the user would advance or
          retreat as necessary.<br />

        <h2>Form III</h2>
        <p>
          Form 3 of the 7 lightsabers forms is called <strong>Soresu</strong>,
          also known as <strong>The Way of the Mynock</strong>,<br />
          or <strong>The Resilience Form</strong>. This form was created as an
          extension of the blaster reflection<br />
          used in form 1, this form focuses entirely on defense. Users of this
          form stay on the<br />
          defensive while they analyze their opponents’ movements looking for
          weaknesses, they wait for<br />
          their enemy to fatigue or become frustrated and make mistakes before
          they strike.<br />

        <h2>Form IV</h2>
        <p>
          Form 4 out of 7 is called <strong>Ataru</strong>, also known as
          <strong>The Aggression Form</strong>. Form 4 was<br />
          developed centuries after form 3 and could be considered the opposite
          of form 3 because<br />
          Ataru focused solely on offense while Soresu focused on defense. Ataru
          is best suited for open<br />
          spaces as it relies on using the force to enhance movements and is
          overall a highly acrobatic style.<br />

        <h2>Form V</h2>
        <p>
          Form 5 out of 7 has two disciplines <strong>Djem So</strong>, and
          <strong>Shien</strong>, this form is also known as<br />
          <strong>The Way of the Krayt Dragon</strong>, or
          <strong>The Perseverance Form</strong>. This form was created by<br />
          users of Soresu who thought that the fights were taking too long when
          they were waiting for<br />
          an opening instead of creating their own openings. Shien, the
          classical form of form 5, was more<br />
          adept at blocking blaster bolts instead of lightsaber combat, whereas
          Djem So was specifically created<br />
          for lightsaber combat; however, both forms relied on using their
          opponent’s power against them.<br />

        <h2>Form VI</h2>
        <p>
          Form 6 out of 7 is called <strong>Niman</strong>, also known as
          <strong>The Way of the Rancor</strong>,
          <strong>The Moderation <br />Form</strong>, or
          <strong>The Diplomat’s Form</strong>. This form didn’t specialize in
          one aspect, instead<br />
          was a culmination of everything, this has the drawbacks of not having
          any significant advantage,<br />
          but also not having many drawbacks as well. This is a more relaxed
          form mainly<br />
          used by Jedi who preferred to devote their time to studying or<br />
          diplomacy; however, if mastered this form could be devastating in
          combat.<br />

        <h2>Form VII</h2>
        <p>
          The last form, form 7 is called <strong>Juyo</strong>, with a
          derivative called <strong>Vapaad</strong>, this form<br />
          is also known as <strong> The Way of the Vornskr</strong>, or
          <strong>The Ferocity Form</strong>. This form<br />
          was a highly aggressive form of lightsaber combat that relied on using
          one’s emotions to<br />
          gain dominance in combat, thus the Jedi banned this form. Later the
          derivative of this<br />
          form was created called Vapaad, this version of the form channeled<br />
          the user’s inner darkness during combat and accept the opponent’s
          fury.<br />
